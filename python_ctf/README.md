# End User Manual

How would I like use this code?

Suppose I have a table called `people` stored in CTF.

TODO: Define and describe `people` table.

```bash
$ cat people.csv
names       age
Shawheen    21
Julian      20
Clark       34
```

I want to access a column called `names` from this table.

```SQL
SELECT names FROM people
```

Assume that `people` is a directory containing the CTF data.

```python
import CTF

names = CTF.load_column("people", "names")
```

TODO: look at `load_column`, see what the most common name is for reading / loading data.
How closely can we copy `csv` from the standard library?

Use case: it would be great if we could access the data as a stream, without necessarily loading everything in memory.
We can get this feature by having `names` be an iterator or generator over the column values.
 
Example processing names:

```
from Collections import Counter

counts = Counter(names)
```

## Use case 2 - column types

```
age = CTF.load_column("people", "age")
```

`age` should generate integer values corresponding to each entry of the `age` column.
CTF knows that the `age` column means integer because of the metadata file in the `people` directory.
TODO: link to W3 standard.

```
# User should not write this- it's just the idea we want
def create_age():
    for x in [21, 20, 34]:
        yield x

age = create_age()

# User can do something like this:
>>> list(age)
[21, 20, 34]
```


## Use case 3 - compatibility with `csv`

```
import csv

# Referring to file `people.csv` in CSV format
r = csv.reader("people.csv")

# Referring to directory `people` in CTF format
r2 = CTF.reader("people")
```

`r2` should essentially be a drop in replacement for `r`.

```
for row in r:
    process(row)
```

TODO: Process a csv file using Python's `csv` package- any kind of data analysis is fine.
For example, find the set of all values in one column.

# Outline
- Ctf modeled after csv and/or dictionary
    - [ ] Should Ctf be accessed with a reader like csv or through itself like a dictionary
    - [x] Column accessed with ["column_name"]
    - [ ] Can convert a csv file to ctf
    - [ ] Reader runs like csv reader returning iterable rows
    - [ ] class Row to give a guide for adding new columns using values from metadata.json
    - [ ] Use custom exceptions
    - [ ] Get type from metadata.json or autodetect
