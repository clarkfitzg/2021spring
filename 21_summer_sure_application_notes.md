## Research Goals

Broad:

- Develop new computational approaches to processing large data sets
- Democratize big data by making the technology more accessible to a broader user base, including those with limited funds for computing
- Create high quality software implementations of our ideas

Focused:

- Improve efficiency and speed by storing plain text data in a columnar format
- Increase reliability and reduce ambiguity in data storage formats by adapting an existing metadata standard designed for web browsers, and use it for data analysis
- Scale existing tools to larger data sets by partitioning data into chunks suitable for parallel and distributed processing

It's going to take a dedicated effort for several years if this idea is really going to take off and make a difference.

Entry points for students:

- develop software
- write documentation
- test cases
- write case studies- good for students interested in applied statistics

Our goals in this project are to combine the computational efficiency of column stores with the interoperability and ease of understanding of plain text.
This summer we plan to write software in at least two of the three popular languages used in data science: R, Python, and Julia.



## Outputs

- Blog posts
- Software
- conference presentation?
- article in JSS?

## Outline

### your commitment to the project

- I plan to spend at least one month this summer focused primarily on this project
- one month summer salary from startup
- not teaching summer school
- funds to experiment with large data sets in Amazon Web Service AWS, and to make it publicly available

### how this student project contributes to your own research goals and direction 

### Outcomes

- release high quality software implementation of CTF, most likely PyPI
- paper describing the purpose of this new data format
