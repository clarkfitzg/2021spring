# Hackair
* App that lets you access, collect, and improve information about air quality in Europe 
* Users can contribute by building their own sensors, uploading pictures which are processed to estimate air quality
* Geotagged pictures from sources like Instagram are also gathered 
* Data from these unconventional sources are fused with official data (like the data we are looking at) to give estimations of air quality even in places without coverage 

# Wind Integration National Dataset (WIND) Toolkit
* This is a paper on a dataset that is useful for grid integration studies 
* Grid integration studies provide "an analytical framework for evaluating a power system with high levels of variable RE" and "a primary goal of a grid integration study is to address stakeholder concerns that a power system can operate reliably and cost-effectively under high-RE scenarios"
* They would consider things like the reduction in wind speed from other wind farms which is known as the wake effect 
* From the article, "This article describes the creation and validation of a data set that has been especially designed for wind integration studies: the Wind Integration National Dataset, also known as the WIND Toolkit. The WIND Toolkit is a combination of a meteorological data set provided by a mesoscale model, a power data set, and a forecast data set."
