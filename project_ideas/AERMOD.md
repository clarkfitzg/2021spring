### Background
> The Guideline on Air Quality Models (published as Appendix W to 40 CFR Part 51) is used by the EPA, other federal, state, territorial, and local air quality agencies, and industry to prepare and review new source permits, source permit modifications, SIP submittals and revisions, conformity, and other air quality assessments required under EPA regulation. The Guideline serves as a means by which national consistency is maintained in air quality analyses for regulatory activities. In April 2000, EPA proposed that the AERMOD Modeling System be adopted as a replacement to ISC3 in Appendix A of the Guideline. In November 2005, the EPA finalized this proposal, and formally adopted AERMOD as the preferred dispersion model for many regulatory applications. This promulgation of AERMOD represented the culmination of over a decade of development, evaluation, and review, including multiple rounds of public comment through the formal rule making process. In 2017, the EPA finalized a 2015 proposal that updated the Guideline and included enhancements to the formulation and application of the EPA’s AERMOD.

### Implementation
AERMOD is implemented using Fortran as a DOS program, although I was able to find a potential way to compile the Fortran code in linux [Reference](https://www.envitrans.com/compile-and-run-aermod-on-linux-platform.php)

AERMET is a meteorological preprocessor for AERMOD.[Reference](https://www.epa.gov/scram/meteorological-processors-and-accessory-programs)

The AERMINUTE program processes 1-minute ASOS wind data available from the 
National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) in the TD-6405 or TD-6401 format to 
generate hourly averaged wind speed and wind direction to supplement the 
standard hourly ASOS observations. The hourly averaged wind speed and direction 
generated by the AERMINUTE program can be merged with data from standard surface 
archives, such as ISHD, along with upper air and site-specific data (if available) 
in Stage 2 of AERMET processing.[Reference](https://gaftp.epa.gov/Air/aqmg/SCRAM/models/met/aerminute/readme_aerminute.txt)

The AERMOD model utilizes a file of surface boundary layer parameters and a file of
profile variables including wind speed, wind direction, and turbulence parameters. These two
types of meteorological inputs are generated by the meteorological preprocessor for AERMOD,
which is called AERMET (EPA, 2018c). Both of these meteorological input files are sequential
ASCII files, and the model automatically recognizes the format generated by AERMET as the
default format. The model will process all available meteorological data in the specified input
file by default, but the user can easily specify selected days or ranges of days to process.

[1.2.3.5 Output options](https://gaftp.epa.gov/Air/aqmg/SCRAM/models/preferred/aermod/aermod_userguide.pdf)
The basic types of printed output available with AERMOD are: 
1-7
 Summaries of high values (highest, second highest, etc.) by receptor for each
averaging period and source group combination;
 Summaries of overall maximum values (e.g., the maximum 50) for each averaging
period and source group combination; and
 Tables of concurrent values summarized by receptor for each averaging period and
source group combination for each day of data processed. These "raw"
concentration values may also be output to unformatted (binary) files, as described
below. 

### Notes
- AERMOD appears to only work in the cause-effect direction

### Definitions
- [Receptors](https://files.nc.gov/ncdeq/Air%20Quality/permits/mets/Guidance.pdf) Receptors are points, defined by the modeler, that represent physical locations at which
the air dispersion models will predict ambient pollutant concentrations. Groups of Cartesian or
polar receptors are usually defined as “receptor grids”. Deciding which type to use is largely a
function of the type of modeling being performed (screening or refined), the size and number of
emission sources, or the site location (including topography), and should be selected to provide
the best “coverage” for the facility being modeled.
