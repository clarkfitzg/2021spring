> Attach a 1-2 page Project Justification showing your commitment to the project, how this student project contributes to your own research goals and direction and what outcomes you expect to accomplish with this project including the potential for future research, external presentation with student, grant application and/or publication. 

Our goals in this project are to combine the computational efficiency of column stores with the interoperability and ease of understanding of plain text.
This summer we plan to write software in at least two of the three popular languages used in data science: R, Python, and Julia.

I plan to spend at least one month this summer focused exclusively on this project.

Outputs:

- Blog posts
- Software
- conference presentation?
- article in JSS?
